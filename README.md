### Title: Random Forest Classification
### Author: Pablo Eliseo Reynoso Aguirre

### Description: 
               This project recalls the implementation of random forest [2-3] based on CART decision trees (gini-index) [1] to solve
               different classification tasks. In this implemenatation we considered different datasets retrieved from Kaggle:
               mushrooms dataset [7], sms spam dataset [8], taekwondo dataset [5], zoo dataset [4]. We also considered contact lenses
               toy set[6] - UPC. In this implementation we also considered data pre processng and shaping, normalization, 
               and text vectorizations tf-idf for feature extractions in the sms spam dataset.
